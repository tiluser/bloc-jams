## Checkpoint 3 assignment: Submit two explanations to your mentor using Markdown formatting that reflect on the information above:
1. Explain the difference between absolute and relative positioning.

Absolute positioning is removed from the normal flow of a document while relative is not. 


2. Explain how box-sizing: border-box treats contained content differently than the default browser box-sizing.

The default box-sizing for the browser is box-sizing: content-box. This means we add padding to the outer box, which increases the width and height of the box. 

box-sizing: border box adds the padding but the width and height stay the same.
